### Script Outline

**[0:00-1:30] Introduction & Hook**

> "Good morning, teachers! Let me start with a question: How many times today have you already used artificial intelligence? Think about it for a moment. If you checked your email this morning, AI filtered your spam. If you asked Siri or Alexa a question, that was AI. If Netflix recommended a show, AI made that suggestion. The truth is, AI is already everywhere in our lives—we just don't always recognize it.
>
> I'm Dr. Gabriela González, and welcome to Week 1 of AI Literacy for Educators. This week, we're answering the fundamental question: What actually IS artificial intelligence?"

**[1:30-4:00] Defining AI Simply**

**On-screen text:** "Artificial Intelligence (AI): Computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence"

> "At its core, artificial intelligence is about teaching computers to do things that usually require human thinking. But let's be clear: AI doesn't 'think' the way humans do. It doesn't understand or feel. It recognizes patterns and makes predictions based on massive amounts of data.
>
> Think of it this way: If I show you 10,000 pictures of cats and 10,000 pictures of dogs, you'll learn to tell them apart, right? AI does something similar—but instead of truly 'learning' like you do, it finds mathematical patterns in the data. It notices that cats tend to have pointed ears, dogs tend to have longer snouts, and so on.
>
> The key word here is 'tend to'—AI works with probabilities and patterns, not absolute truth."

**[4:00-7:00] Types of AI**

**Visual:** Venn diagram showing AI → Machine Learning → Deep Learning

> "You'll hear several terms used interchangeably, so let's clarify:
>
> **Artificial Intelligence** is the broad field—any computer system that mimics human intelligence.
>
> **Machine Learning** is a subset of AI where computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario. Instead of saying 'if the email contains these exact words, mark it as spam,' we give the system thousands of spam examples and let it find the patterns.
>
> **Deep Learning** is a subset of machine learning inspired by how human brains work—using networks of 'neurons' to process information. This is what powers tools like ChatGPT, image recognition, and voice assistants.
>
> For our purposes in education, you'll mostly interact with machine learning and deep learning systems."

**Visual:** Two columns comparing Narrow AI vs. General AI

> "Another important distinction: **Narrow AI** versus **General AI**.
>
> **Narrow AI** (also called Weak AI) is designed for specific tasks: spam filtering, voice recognition, chess playing, content recommendation. Every AI system you use today is narrow AI. ChatGPT is incredible at language tasks, but it can't drive a car or recognize faces.
>
> **General AI** (Strong AI) would be a system that could do any intellectual task a human can do—think like humans, understand context, transfer knowledge across domains. This doesn't exist yet. It's theoretical, and we may never achieve it. So when we talk about 'AI in education,' we're always talking about narrow AI tools for specific purposes."

**[7:00-10:30] AI in Your Daily Life (Examples)**

**Visual:** Grid of everyday AI applications with icons

> "Let's ground this in reality. Here are AI systems you probably use regularly:
>
> **Email spam filters** - Machine learning analyzes millions of emails to identify spam patterns
>
> **Autocomplete and autocorrect** - Predictive text on your phone uses AI to guess what you'll type next based on your habits and common language patterns
>
> **Voice assistants** - Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant use natural language processing (a type of AI) to understand your questions
>
> **GPS navigation** - Apps like Google Maps use AI to predict traffic, suggest routes, and estimate arrival times
>
> **Streaming recommendations** - Netflix, Spotify, YouTube analyze your viewing/listening history to suggest content
>
> **Photo organization** - Your phone automatically groups photos by faces, locations, or objects using computer vision AI
>
> **Social media feeds** - Algorithms decide what posts you see based on your engagement patterns
>
> **Online shopping** - 'Customers who bought this also bought...' is AI-driven recommendation
>
> Notice a pattern? Most AI systems today are about prediction, recommendation, recognition, and automation of repetitive tasks."

**[10:30-13:00] What AI Is NOT**

**Visual:** "Myth vs. Reality" comparison table

> "Before we move on, let's dispel some myths:
>
> **Myth 1:** AI is conscious or sentient.
> **Reality:** AI has no awareness, feelings, or consciousness. It's statistical pattern matching.
>
> **Myth 2:** AI will replace teachers.
> **Reality:** AI can't replicate the human relationships, emotional intelligence, ethical judgment, and contextual understanding that define great teaching. It's a tool, not a replacement.
>
> **Myth 3:** AI is objective and unbiased.
> **Reality:** AI reflects the biases in its training data. If trained on biased historical data, it reproduces those biases. We'll explore this in Week 5.
>
> **Myth 4:** AI 'knows' things.
> **Reality:** AI generates responses based on patterns in data. It doesn't 'know' facts the way humans do. ChatGPT can confidently state incorrect information if it aligns with patterns in its training data.
>
> **Myth 5:** You need to be tech-savvy to use AI.
> **Reality:** Modern AI tools are designed for everyone. If you can use Google, you can use ChatGPT."

**[13:00-15:00] Why Teachers Need to Understand AI**

> "So why does all this matter for you as an educator?
>
> **First:** Your students are already using AI—for homework, research, writing. You need to understand it to guide them ethically.
>
> **Second:** AI can save you hours every week on lesson planning, grading, and administrative tasks—time you can redirect to what matters most: your students.
>
> **Third:** Understanding AI helps you advocate for your students. You can identify when AI tools are helpful versus harmful, equitable versus biased.
>
> **Fourth:** AI literacy is becoming as fundamental as digital literacy. Your students need you to model critical, informed AI use.
>
> By the end of this course, you'll be equipped to use AI as a teaching ally while maintaining your professional autonomy and expertise.
>
> In our next video, we'll explore how we got here—a brief history of AI from Alan Turing to ChatGPT. See you there!"

## 📹 Video 2: A Brief History of AI - From Turing to ChatGPT (10 minutes)

### Learning Objectives
- Trace major milestones in AI development
- Understand why AI progress accelerated recently
- Connect historical context to current educational AI tools
- Recognize patterns of AI "hype" versus reality

### Script Outline

**[0:00-1:00] Introduction**

> "Welcome back! Understanding where AI came from helps us understand where it's going—and where it's NOT going. Let's take a quick journey through AI history, focusing on the moments that brought us to tools like ChatGPT."

**[1:00-2:30] The Beginning: 1950s - Alan Turing**

**Visual:** Photo of Alan Turing, image of Turing Test diagram

> "Our story begins in 1950 with British mathematician Alan Turing, who asked a provocative question: 'Can machines think?'
>
> Turing proposed a test: If a human judge can't distinguish between a machine's responses and a human's responses in a conversation, the machine could be considered 'intelligent.' This became known as the Turing Test.
>
> In 1956, the term 'artificial intelligence' was officially coined at a conference at Dartmouth College. Researchers were incredibly optimistic, predicting human-level AI within 20 years. Spoiler alert: that didn't happen."

**[2:30-4:00] The First AI Winter: 1970s**

**Visual:** Graph showing AI funding over time with "winters" marked

> "By the 1970s, AI hit its first 'winter'—a period of reduced funding and interest. Early AI systems could solve math problems and play simple games, but they couldn't handle real-world complexity.
>
> The problem? Computers were too slow, datasets were too small, and researchers underestimated how hard it is to replicate human intelligence. Funding dried up, and AI became a dirty word in tech."

**[4:00-5:30] Expert Systems & The Second AI Boom: 1980s**

> "AI bounced back in the 1980s with 'expert systems'—programs that mimicked human expert decision-making in narrow domains. Medical diagnosis systems, financial advisors, factory automation.
>
> But by the late 1980s, another AI winter arrived. Expert systems were expensive, hard to maintain, and couldn't learn or adapt. They were rigid rule-based systems, not true learning machines."

**[5:30-7:30] The Machine Learning Revolution: 1990s-2010s**

**Visual:** Timeline showing key ML breakthroughs

> "The real turning point came with machine learning. Instead of programming every rule, researchers let computers learn from data.
>
> **1997** - IBM's Deep Blue beats world chess champion Garry Kasparov
> **2011** - IBM Watson wins Jeopardy!
> **2012** - Deep learning breakthrough: neural networks dramatically improve image recognition
> **2016** - AlphaGo beats world Go champion (Go is vastly more complex than chess)
>
> What changed? Three things:
> 1. **Computing power** - GPUs (graphics processing units) made training large models feasible
> 2. **Big data** - The internet provided massive training datasets
> 3. **Algorithm improvements** - Deep learning architectures became more sophisticated"

**[7:30-9:00] The Generative AI Era: 2017-Present**

**Visual:** Logos of ChatGPT, DALL-E, Midjourney, Claude

> "The newest revolution is **generative AI**—systems that create new content: text, images, music, code.
>
> **2017** - Google introduces the Transformer architecture, the foundation of modern language models
> **2020** - GPT-3 demonstrates impressive language generation
> **2022** - ChatGPT launches publicly and reaches 100 million users in 2 months—the fastest-growing app in history
> **2023-2024** - Explosion of AI tools: Claude, Gemini, Copilot, DALL-E, Midjourney, and hundreds of education-specific tools
>
> We're now in what some call the 'golden age' of AI usability. For the first time, powerful AI is accessible to everyone, not just researchers or corporations."

**[9:00-10:00] Lessons from History & Looking Ahead**

> "What can we learn from this history?
>
> **Lesson 1:** AI progress is not linear. We've had multiple boom-and-bust cycles. Current excitement may or may not lead to sustained transformation.
>
> **Lesson 2:** Narrow AI succeeds; general AI remains elusive. Don't believe claims of human-level AI 'just around the corner.'
>
> **Lesson 3:** The real breakthroughs come from better data and computing, not just clever algorithms.
>
> **Lesson 4:** Hype is part of AI's DNA. Separate realistic applications from science fiction.
>
> For educators, this means: Use AI tools that solve real problems today. Don't wait for perfect AI. And stay skeptical of claims that AI will 'revolutionize' everything.
>
> Next video: How do large language models like ChatGPT actually work? See you there!"

### Key Takeaways

## 📹 Video 3: Understanding Large Language Models (20 minutes)

### Learning Objectives
- Explain how large language models (LLMs) work in non-technical terms
- Understand why LLMs sometimes make mistakes ("hallucinations")
- Identify implications for educational use
- Develop realistic expectations for LLM capabilities

### Script Outline

**[0:00-1:30] Introduction**

> "Let's tackle the question you're probably most curious about: How does ChatGPT actually work? How can a computer program write essays, answer questions, and generate lesson plans?
>
> The technology behind ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini is called a **Large Language Model**, or LLM. And I promise, you don't need a computer science degree to understand the basics."

**[1:30-4:30] The Core Concept: Predicting the Next Word**

**Visual:** Interactive demonstration showing word prediction

> "At its heart, an LLM does one thing: **predicts the next most likely word** based on the words that came before.
>
> Let me demonstrate. If I write: 'The capital of France is...' what word would you predict next? Probably 'Paris,' right?
>
> That's what an LLM does—but at a massive scale, with billions of parameters analyzing patterns in text.
>
> **Example:** I type 'Once upon a...' → The LLM calculates probabilities:
> - 'time' (85% likely)
> - 'while' (10% likely)
> - 'midnight' (3% likely)
> - Other words (2% likely)
>
> It doesn't 'know' that fairy tales start with 'once upon a time.' It has seen that pattern millions of times in its training data and calculates it's the most probable continuation.
>
> Then it predicts the next word after 'time,' then the next, then the next—generating a complete response word by word."

**[4:30-8:00] Training: Learning from Massive Text Data**

**Visual:** Infographic showing training data sources and process

> "So where does this prediction ability come from? **Training.**
>
> LLMs are trained on enormous amounts of text from the internet: books, websites, articles, Wikipedia, Reddit, code repositories—hundreds of billions of words.
>
> During training, the model sees a sentence with one word hidden and tries to predict that word. It makes a guess, checks if it's right, and adjusts its internal 'weights' (mathematical parameters) to get better at predicting. This happens billions of times.
>
> **Example training scenario:**
> - Training text: 'The water cycle includes evaporation, condensation, and ___'
> - Model guesses: 'rain'
> - Correct answer: 'precipitation'
> - Model adjusts to increase the probability of 'precipitation' in similar contexts
>
> After training on massive datasets, the model has learned statistical patterns about:
> - How language works (grammar, syntax)
> - Common word associations
> - Factual information (though imperfectly)
> - Patterns of reasoning and explanation
> - Different writing styles and formats
>
> **Important:** The model doesn't 'remember' specific training documents. It learns patterns, not facts."

**[8:00-11:00] Why LLMs Sometimes Make Mistakes ("Hallucinations")**

**Visual:** Examples of AI hallucinations with corrections

> "Here's the catch: LLMs generate plausible-sounding text, not necessarily accurate text.
>
> When an LLM generates false or nonsensical information with confidence, we call this a '**hallucination**.'
>
> **Example hallucination:**
> - Prompt: 'Who won the Nobel Prize for inventing the water cycle?'
> - ChatGPT might respond: 'Dr. James Water won the 1987 Nobel Prize for...'
>
> There is no Dr. James Water. The water cycle wasn't invented. But the model has seen patterns like 'Dr. [Name] won the [Year] Nobel Prize for [discovery]' and generates a plausible-sounding answer.
>
> **Why does this happen?**
>
> 1. **No fact-checking mechanism** - The model doesn't verify information against a database of truth; it just predicts likely text
> 2. **Training data contains errors** - The internet includes misinformation, and the model learns from it
> 3. **Gaps in training data** - If asked about obscure topics, the model fills gaps with plausible-sounding guesses
> 4. **No understanding** - The model doesn't 'know' what's true; it knows what's statistically likely based on patterns
>
> **For teachers, this means:** Always verify factual content generated by AI, especially for science, history, and current events."

**[11:00-14:00] Implications for Educational Use**

> "Understanding how LLMs work helps you use them effectively and avoid pitfalls.
>
> **What LLMs are GOOD at:**
> - Generating drafts and brainstorming ideas
> - Explaining concepts in different ways
> - Creating practice problems and examples
> - Reformatting or summarizing text
> - Suggesting discussion questions
> - Adapting content to different reading levels
> - Providing structure and templates
>
> **What LLMs are NOT good at:**
> - Guaranteeing factual accuracy (especially for specialized topics)
> - Original research or citing specific sources reliably
> - Understanding context or student needs without your input
> - Making pedagogical decisions (that's your job!)
> - Replacing human judgment about what's appropriate for your students
>
> **Best practice:** Think of LLMs as brilliant interns—they can draft, suggest, and organize, but you're the expert who reviews and approves everything."

**[14:00-17:00] How to Get Better Results: The Basics of Prompting**

**Visual:** Side-by-side comparison of vague vs. specific prompts

> "Since LLMs predict based on patterns, the quality of your input (your 'prompt') dramatically affects the quality of output.
>
> **Vague prompt:**
> 'Create a lesson plan about fractions.'
>
> **Specific prompt:**
> 'Create a 45-minute lesson plan for 4th grade students on adding fractions with unlike denominators. Include a real-world hook, guided practice with manipulatives, independent practice problems at three difficulty levels, and a quick formative assessment. My students struggle with finding common denominators.'
>
> The second prompt gives the LLM more patterns to work with: grade level, specific skill, lesson components, student context. Result? Much better output.
>
> **Three quick prompting tips:**
> 1. **Be specific** - Grade level, subject, context, format
> 2. **Give examples** - Show the style or format you want
> 3. **Iterate** - If the first output isn't right, refine your prompt and try again
>
> We'll dive deeper into prompt engineering in Week 2."

**[17:00-20:00] The Human-AI Partnership in Teaching**

> "Here's the most important point: You are not competing with AI. You're collaborating with it.
>
> **AI provides:** Speed, draft content, pattern recognition, formatting, scale
> **You provide:** Expertise, context, judgment, relationship, ethical guidance, adaptation
>
> **Example workflow:**
> 1. You provide context: '5th grade, mixed abilities, urban school, learning about ecosystems'
> 2. AI generates: Draft lesson plan with activities
> 3. You evaluate: 'This activity won't work in my classroom, but this one is great'
> 4. You adapt: Modify for your students, add your examples, adjust for time
> 5. You teach: Using your professional expertise and student relationships
> 6. AI can't do steps 3-5. Only you can.
>
> This course is about becoming a confident, critical user of AI tools—someone who leverages the technology while maintaining professional autonomy.
>
> In our next video, we'll explore the UNESCO framework that guides our approach to AI in education. See you there!"

### Discussion Prompts

1. What surprised you about how LLMs work?
2. Have you experienced an AI "hallucination"? Share the example.
3. How does understanding the prediction mechanism change how you'll use AI tools?

### Key Takeaways

- LLMs predict next words based on patterns in training data
- Training involves billions of text examples from the internet
- "Hallucinations" occur because LLMs generate plausible text, not verified facts
- LLMs excel at drafting, explaining, and formatting; humans excel at judgment and context
- Quality prompts lead to quality outputs
- AI is a collaborative tool, not a replacement for teacher expertise

### Learning Objectives
- Identify the five core dimensions of the UNESCO AI Competency Framework
- Explain the three proficiency levels (Acquire, Deepen, Create)
- Understand human-centered AI principles in education
- Connect course content to UNESCO framework dimensions

### Script Outline

**[0:00-2:00] Introduction: Why We Need a Framework**

> "Welcome to our final video for Week 1. By now you understand what AI is and how it works. But here's the question: How should teachers engage with AI?
>
> Fortunately, we don't have to figure this out alone. UNESCO—the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization—has developed a comprehensive framework for teacher AI competencies.
>
> This framework ensures that as we adopt AI in education, we do so in a way that's **human-centered, equitable, ethical, and pedagogically sound**. Our entire course is aligned with this framework."

**[2:00-4:30] The Five Core Dimensions**

**Visual:** Pentagon diagram showing five dimensions

> "The UNESCO AI Competency Framework has five interconnected dimensions. Think of these as five lenses through which to view AI in education.
>
> **Dimension 1: Human-Centered Mindset**
> This is our foundation. AI must serve human needs and values, not the other way around. You—the teacher—remain the decision-maker. AI enhances your agency; it doesn't diminish it.
>
> Questions this dimension addresses:
> - How do we maintain teacher autonomy?
> - How do we ensure AI serves students, not corporate interests?
> - How do we preserve the human relationships central to learning?
>
> **Dimension 2: Ethics of AI**
> Every AI tool embodies values and can perpetuate harm if used uncritically. This dimension focuses on:
> - Identifying bias in AI systems
> - Protecting student privacy and data
> - Ensuring equity and inclusion
> - Promoting transparency and accountability
>
> **Dimension 3: AI Foundations and Applications**
> This is the technical literacy—understanding how AI works (what we've covered this week!) and how to select and use appropriate tools.
> - What is machine learning?
> - How do I evaluate AI tools for my classroom?
> - What are the capabilities and limitations?
>
> **Dimension 4: AI Pedagogy**
> How do we integrate AI into teaching and learning in pedagogically sound ways?
> - Using AI for lesson planning and assessment
> - Supporting diverse learners with AI
> - Fostering critical thinking about AI
> - Designing AI-enhanced learning experiences
>
> **Dimension 5: AI for Professional Learning**
> Using AI for your own continuous professional development:
> - Personalized learning pathways
> - Collaboration with colleagues via AI tools
> - Staying current with educational research
> - Reflective practice supported by AI
>
> Our course touches all five dimensions, with particular emphasis on Dimensions 1, 3, and 4."

**[4:30-7:30] The Three Proficiency Levels**

**Visual:** Pyramid showing Acquire → Deepen → Create

> "Within each dimension, there are three proficiency levels:
>
> **Level 1: ACQUIRE (This Course)**
> Foundational AI literacy. You can:
> - Understand basic AI concepts
> - Use common AI tools for teaching tasks
> - Evaluate AI-generated content
> - Apply ethical principles
> - Integrate AI into existing practice
>
> Think of this as building your AI toolkit and confidence. You're acquiring skills to use AI effectively Monday morning.
>
> **Level 2: DEEPEN (Advanced Course)**
> Developing more sophisticated competencies:
> - Designing AI-enhanced learning experiences
> - Analyzing AI's impact on learning outcomes
> - Leading colleagues in AI adoption
> - Customizing AI tools for specific contexts
> - Critically evaluating AI policies
>
> This is where you become an AI leader in your school.

> - Developing new AI-enhanced pedagogies
> - Participating in AI policy development
> - Conducting research on AI in education
> - Mentoring other teachers
> - Advocating for equitable AI adoption
>
> This level is for instructional coaches, teacher educators, and educational leaders.
>
> **Our 6-week course focuses on Level 1: Acquire.** We're building the foundation."

**[7:30-10:30] Human-Centered AI: Core Principles**

> "Let's dive deeper into the most important dimension: the human-centered mindset.
>
> UNESCO identifies several core principles:
>
> **1. Human Agency and Autonomy**
> You make the decisions. AI provides options; you choose. You're never obligated to use AI-generated content as-is.
>
> **Example:** AI generates a quiz. You review every question, check for bias, adjust difficulty, and decide if it's appropriate for your students. You're in control.
>
> **2. Social Responsibility**
> Consider AI's impact on equity, inclusion, and social good. Ask:
> - Does this AI tool work equally well for all my students?
> - Does it advantage some groups over others?
> - Does it respect diverse cultural contexts?
>
> **Example:** An AI reading comprehension tool trained primarily on Western literature might not work well for students from other cultural backgrounds. Your awareness prevents inequity.
>
> **3. Transparency**
> Understand how AI tools work and be transparent with students about when and why you use AI.
>
> **Example:** 'I used ChatGPT to generate these discussion questions, but I modified them based on our recent class conversations and your interests.'
>
> **4. Fairness and Non-Discrimination**
> Actively work to identify and mitigate bias in AI systems.
>
> **Example:** An AI writing feedback tool might penalize non-standard English dialects. You recognize this and provide equitable feedback manually when needed.
>
> **5. Safety and Privacy**
> Protect student data. Don't input identifiable information into AI tools unless they're FERPA/COPPA compliant.
>
> **Example:** When using ChatGPT to generate personalized feedback, use fictional student names and generic descriptions, not real student data.
>
> These principles aren't abstract—they guide every practical decision you make about AI."

**[10:30-13:00] How This Course Aligns with UNESCO Framework**
