## 💡 Key Insights

After completing this activity, you should notice:

**Insight 1: AI is Already Normalized**
You probably use 10+ AI systems daily without thinking about it. AI isn't futuristic—it's present.

**Insight 2: AI Excels at Specific Tasks**
Most AI you use does narrow, well-defined tasks: filtering, predicting, recommending, recognizing patterns. It doesn't do general-purpose "thinking."

**Insight 3: You're Already Evaluating AI**
You've developed intuitions about which AI systems work well (maybe Gmail spam filter?) and which don't (maybe autocorrect changing words incorrectly?). You'll apply this same critical thinking to educational AI.

**Insight 4: AI Fades into the Background**
The best AI is often invisible—you don't think "I'm using AI" when you use Google Maps. Similarly, the best educational AI will enhance teaching without being obtrusive.

**Insight 5: Convenience vs. Privacy Trade-offs**
Many AI systems work by collecting data about you (your search history, viewing patterns, location). This same trade-off exists with educational AI—more personalization often means more data collection.

**Prompt:** "Which AI system from the scavenger hunt surprised you most, and why?"

Example response:
> "I was shocked to realize that my phone's camera uses AI to automatically enhance photos in real-time—adjusting brightness, contrast, and even suggesting the best moment to take a picture. I've been using this feature for years and never knew it was AI! It made me think about how much AI is invisible but helpful."
