# Your First Teaching Prompt with ChatGPT

**Time:** 20 minutes
**Goal:** Successfully use ChatGPT (or Claude/Gemini) to create useful classroom content

---

## 🎯 Activity Overview

This is your hands-on introduction to using AI for teaching. You'll create your first prompt, generate content, evaluate the output, and learn to iterate for better results.

**By the end of this activity, you'll have:**
- A ChatGPT account (free)
- Experience writing effective prompts
- One piece of classroom-ready content (or close to it!)
- Confidence to experiment further

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Set Up Your AI Tool (5 minutes)

You'll need access to one of these free AI assistants:

**Option A: ChatGPT (Recommended for this course)**
1. Go to [https://chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com)
2. Click "Sign up" and create a free account (use your personal email, not school email unless your district has approved it)
3. Verify your email
4. You'll have access to GPT-3.5 (free version) - this is sufficient for most teaching tasks

**Option B: Claude**
1. Go to [https://claude.ai](https://claude.ai)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Claude is excellent for detailed explanations and structured content

**Option C: Google Gemini**
1. Go to [https://gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Great if you use Google Workspace heavily

**For this activity, we'll use ChatGPT examples, but the principles apply to all three tools.**

### Step 2: Understand the Anatomy of a Good Prompt (3 minutes)

Before you write your first prompt, let's break down what makes a prompt effective.

**Weak Prompt:**
```
Create a lesson plan about ecosystems.
```

**Strong Prompt:**
```
Create a 45-minute lesson plan for 5th grade students on food chains and food webs in ecosystems. Include:
- A hook/anticipatory set to capture attention
- Direct instruction on producers, consumers, and decomposers
- A hands-on activity where students create a food web
- 5 formative assessment questions

My students are in a suburban public school with mixed abilities. Some students struggle with reading comprehension, so include visual supports.
```

**What makes the second prompt better?**

✅ **Specific grade level** (5th grade, not just "students")
✅ **Specific topic** (food chains/webs, not just "ecosystems")
✅ **Clear format** (lesson plan with specific components)
✅ **Time constraint** (45 minutes)
✅ **Student context** (mixed abilities, reading challenges)
✅ **Specific output requests** (visual supports, 5 questions)

**Golden Rule: The more context you give, the better output you get.**

---

### Step 3: Choose Your Task (2 minutes)

For your first prompt, choose ONE of these teaching tasks:

**Option 1: Lesson Plan**
Generate a complete lesson plan for an upcoming topic you'll teach

**Option 2: Discussion Questions**
Create 8-10 discussion questions for a text or topic you're teaching

**Option 3: Differentiated Reading**
Adapt a text or passage to 3 different reading levels

**Option 4: Assessment**
Create a formative assessment (quiz, exit ticket, or activity) for a recent lesson

**Option 5: Parent Communication**
Draft an email to parents about an upcoming unit, event, or classroom expectation

**My choice:** _________________________________

---

### Step 4: Write Your First Prompt (3 minutes)

Use this template to structure your prompt:

```
[Action verb: Create/Generate/Write/Design] a [specific format] for [grade level] students on [specific topic].

Include:
- [Component 1]
- [Component 2]
- [Component 3]

Context about my students: [relevant details about abilities, challenges, interests, school setting]

[Any additional specifications: length, style, constraints]
```

**Example for Option 1 (Lesson Plan):**
```
Create a 50-minute lesson plan for 7th grade students on the causes of the American Revolution.

Include:
- An engaging hook that connects to students' lives today
- Direct instruction covering taxation without representation, Boston Tea Party, and colonial grievances
- A primary source analysis activity using an excerpt from the Declaration of Independence
- Guided discussion questions
- An exit ticket to assess understanding

Context about my students: Urban public school, diverse backgrounds, many students are visual learners, mix of reading levels from 5th-9th grade.

Format the lesson plan with clear timing for each section.
```

**Now write YOUR prompt:**

_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

### Step 5: Generate Your First Output (2 minutes)

1. Copy your prompt
2. Open ChatGPT (or your chosen AI tool)
3. Paste your prompt into the chat box
4. Click "Send" or press Enter
5. Wait for the response (usually 15-30 seconds)

**What to expect:**
- ChatGPT will generate content based on your prompt
- The response will be formatted as text
- You can ask follow-up questions or request revisions

---

### Step 6: Evaluate the Output (3 minutes)

Use this evaluation rubric to assess what ChatGPT generated:

| Criterion | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ No |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Accurate content** (no errors or "hallucinations") | | | |
| **Age-appropriate** for your grade level | | | |
| **Aligned with your prompt** (includes what you asked for) | | | |
| **Usable as-is** (could use Monday without changes) | | | |
| **Culturally responsive** (appropriate for your students) | | | |
| **Engaging** (would capture student interest) | | | |

**Overall rating:**
- [ ] Great! Ready to use with minor tweaks
- [ ] Good foundation, but needs significant editing
- [ ] Not quite what I needed—I'll revise my prompt

---

### Step 7: Iterate and Improve (3 minutes)

If your output wasn't perfect (and it probably wasn't!), that's normal. Now you'll learn to refine.

**Common issues and how to fix them:**

**Issue 1: Too generic or vague**
→ **Solution:** Add more specific details to your prompt
Example follow-up: "Can you make the hook more specific to urban students' experiences? Maybe relate taxation to local issues they care about?"

**Issue 2: Wrong difficulty level**
→ **Solution:** Specify reading level or adjust complexity
Example follow-up: "This is too advanced for my 5th graders. Can you simplify the vocabulary and use shorter sentences?"

**Issue 3: Missing components**
→ **Solution:** Request specific additions
Example follow-up: "Can you add 3 visual supports or graphic organizers to help struggling readers?"

**Issue 4: Factual errors** (hallucinations)
→ **Solution:** Verify facts and request corrections
Example follow-up: "I noticed an error in question 3—the Boston Tea Party was in 1773, not 1776. Can you correct this and double-check the other dates?"

**Issue 5: Doesn't match your teaching style**
→ **Solution:** Describe your style preferences
Example follow-up: "I use a lot of collaborative learning. Can you replace the independent worksheet with a partner or small group activity?"

**Try at least ONE follow-up prompt to improve your output:**

My follow-up prompt:
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

### Step 8: Edit and Personalize (2 minutes)

Even if ChatGPT's output is excellent, **always add your personal touch:**

✏️ **Add student names or local examples** to make it relevant
✏️ **Adjust timing** based on your actual class period
✏️ **Include your classroom routines** (e.g., your specific transition signals)
✏️ **Add connections** to previous lessons or inside jokes
✏️ **Incorporate student interests** that you know from relationships

**Remember: AI provides the draft. You provide the expertise and humanity.**

## 💬 Discussion Forum Prompt

Share your experience in the discussion forum!

**Prompt:** "What did you create with your first teaching prompt, and what surprised you about the experience?"

Example response:
> "I asked ChatGPT to create discussion questions for my 6th graders about 'The Giver' by Lois Lowry. I was impressed by how quickly it generated 10 thoughtful questions ranging from comprehension to deeper thematic analysis. I had to adjust a few to match my students' reading level and add one about our recent class discussion on conformity, but overall it saved me about 20 minutes. What surprised me most was how well it understood the book without me having to summarize the plot!"
