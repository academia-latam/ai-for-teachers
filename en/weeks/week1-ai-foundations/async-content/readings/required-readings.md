- Teachers maintain agency, autonomy, and decision-making authority
- Social responsibility: consider impact on equity, inclusion, and wellbeing
- Critical evaluation: regularly assess AI benefits and risks

**Example at Acquire Level:** "Recognize that AI tools are designed by humans and reflect human values and biases. Maintain responsibility for all educational decisions involving AI."

**2. Ethics of AI**
- Privacy and data protection (student information security)
- Fairness and non-discrimination (identifying and mitigating bias)
- Transparency (understanding how AI systems make decisions)
- Accountability (taking responsibility for AI-assisted outcomes)

**Example at Acquire Level:** "Apply basic ethical principles when using AI tools, such as not sharing identifiable student data with non-FERPA compliant systems."

**3. AI Foundations and Applications**
- Basic understanding of how AI works (machine learning, LLMs, algorithms)
- Awareness of AI capabilities and limitations
- Ability to select appropriate AI tools for educational tasks
- Skill in using AI tools effectively (e.g., prompt engineering)

**Example at Acquire Level:** "Use AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to generate draft lesson plans, adapt content, and create assessments, while understanding that outputs require human review."

**4. AI Pedagogy**
- Integrating AI into teaching and learning in pedagogically sound ways
- Using AI to support diverse learners
- Designing AI-enhanced learning activities
- Fostering student critical thinking about AI

**Example at Acquire Level:** "Use AI tools to differentiate instruction by adapting texts to multiple reading levels or creating scaffolded assignments."

## 📖 Reading 2: Human-Centered AI in Education - Core Principles

**Source:** Adapted from UNESCO and OECD frameworks
**Length:** ~800 words
**Time:** 10 minutes

### What Does "Human-Centered" Mean?

The term "human-centered AI" appears frequently in education policy, but what does it actually mean in practice?

At its core, human-centered AI means that **technology serves people, not the other way around**. In educational contexts, this translates to several concrete principles:

### Principle 1: Teacher Agency and Autonomy

**Definition:** Teachers make the final decisions about pedagogy, assessment, and student support. AI provides options and suggestions; teachers evaluate and choose.

**In Practice:**
- ✅ AI generates a lesson plan → You review, adapt, and decide whether to use it
- ✅ AI suggests quiz questions → You verify accuracy, check for bias, and select appropriate items
- ❌ AI auto-generates and auto-sends student feedback without your review
- ❌ District mandates use of AI tool without teacher input on selection

**Why It Matters:** Teaching is a professional practice requiring contextual judgment. Algorithms can't understand your specific students, their backgrounds, or the nuances of your classroom culture. You can.

### Principle 2: Student Wellbeing and Development

**Definition:** AI tools should support holistic student development—academic, social, emotional—not just performance metrics.

**In Practice:**
- ✅ Using AI to create differentiated materials so all students can access content
- ✅ Using AI to provide timely feedback, which reduces student anxiety about grades
- ❌ Using AI surveillance tools that create a culture of mistrust
- ❌ Over-relying on AI grading such that students never receive personalized human feedback

**Why It Matters:** Education is about developing whole humans, not just raising test scores. AI should enhance learning experiences, not reduce students to data points.

### Principle 3: Equity and Inclusion

**Definition:** AI tools should reduce—not exacerbate—educational inequities. All students should benefit from AI, regardless of background.

**In Practice:**
- ✅ Using AI to create multilingual materials for ELL students
- ✅ Using AI to generate alternative formats (audio, visual) for students with disabilities
- ✅ Being aware that AI trained primarily on standard English may not work well for all dialects
- ❌ Assuming AI-generated content is culturally appropriate for all students without checking
- ❌ Using AI tools only available to wealthier schools/districts

**Why It Matters:** AI systems often reflect biases in their training data. Without intentional attention to equity, AI can worsen existing disparities in education.

**Critical Question:** Do all my students have equal opportunity to benefit from this AI tool? Who might be disadvantaged?

### Principle 4: Transparency and Explainability

**Definition:** Teachers and students should understand how AI systems work and when AI is being used.

**In Practice:**
- ✅ Telling students: "I used ChatGPT to create these practice problems, and I reviewed each one for accuracy"
- ✅ Understanding that an AI grading tool uses a rubric and keyword matching (and knowing its limitations)
- ✅ Being able to explain to parents how you use AI in your classroom
- ❌ Using AI-powered classroom management software without understanding what data it collects or how it makes predictions

**Why It Matters:** Transparency builds trust and enables informed decision-making. If you don't understand how a tool works, you can't advocate for your students when it makes mistakes.

### Principle 5: Privacy and Data Protection

**Definition:** Student data must be protected. AI tools should comply with educational data privacy laws (FERPA in the US, GDPR in Europe, etc.).

**In Practice:**
- ✅ Using school-approved AI tools with data protection agreements
- ✅ Anonymizing student work before inputting it into public AI tools
- ✅ Reading privacy policies before using new AI tools with student data
- ❌ Copying student essays with names into ChatGPT for grading
- ❌ Using free AI tools that sell data to third parties

**Why It Matters:** Once student data is shared, you can't get it back. Data breaches, misuse, and surveillance can cause real harm.

**Golden Rule:** If you wouldn't post it publicly with the student's name on it, don't put it in an AI tool without checking privacy compliance.

### Principle 6: Sustainability and Environmental Impact

**Definition:** Consider the environmental and social costs of AI systems, which require significant computing resources.

**In Practice:**
- ✅ Being intentional about AI use (use it when it adds real value, not just for novelty)
- ✅ Choosing AI providers that prioritize energy efficiency and carbon neutrality
- ✅ Teaching students about the environmental impact of AI systems

**Why It Matters:** Training large AI models requires enormous energy. A single training run for a large language model can emit as much carbon as five cars over their lifetimes. Responsible use means balancing benefits against costs.

### Putting It Together: A Decision-Making Framework

Before using an AI tool in your teaching, ask:

1. **Agency:** Am I maintaining control over pedagogical decisions?
2. **Benefit:** Will this genuinely improve learning or teaching, or is it just novel?
3. **Equity:** Will all my students benefit, or might some be disadvantaged?
4. **Privacy:** Is student data protected?
5. **Transparency:** Do I understand how this tool works and can I explain it?
6. **Values:** Does this align with my educational values and my school's mission?

If you answer "no" or "I'm not sure" to any of these questions, pause and investigate further before proceeding.

### Human-Centered AI in Action: An Example

**Scenario:** You want to provide faster feedback on student writing assignments.

**Human-Centered Approach:**
1. Use AI to generate initial feedback suggestions (efficiency)
2. Review every piece of feedback for accuracy, tone, and appropriateness (agency)
3. Personalize feedback based on your knowledge of each student (human expertise)
4. Check that feedback is culturally responsive and doesn't penalize non-standard dialects (equity)
5. Use a FERPA-compliant AI tool or anonymize student work (privacy)
6. Tell students you used AI to help provide faster feedback (transparency)
7. Reflect: Did this improve the feedback quality and timeliness? Adjust as needed. (continuous improvement)

**Result:** Students get better, faster feedback. You save time. Students learn about appropriate AI use. Everyone benefits.

### Reflection Prompt

Think about a task you currently do in your teaching (lesson planning, grading, parent communication, etc.).

- How might AI help with this task?
- How would you apply human-centered principles to ensure the use is ethical and effective?
- What guardrails would you put in place?

## 📖 Reading 3: Infographic - How ChatGPT Works (Visual Guide)

**Time:** 5 minutes

### Access the Infographic

[Link to visual infographic - to be created or sourced]

**Alternative:** If infographic not available, use this text summary:

### How ChatGPT Generates a Response (Simplified)

**Step 1: You Type a Prompt**
Example: "Create three discussion questions about photosynthesis for 5th graders."

**Step 2: Tokenization**
ChatGPT breaks your prompt into "tokens" (pieces of words). Example: "photo-synthesis" might be split into "photo" + "syn" + "thesis"

**Step 3: Understanding Context**
The model analyzes your tokens and activates relevant "knowledge" (patterns learned during training about: discussion questions, photosynthesis, 5th grade level, education formats)

**Step 4: Predicting the Next Token**
The model predicts the most likely next word (token):
- "1." (90% probability - starting a numbered list is very common for this request)
- "Question" (5% probability)
- "What" (3% probability)
- Other (2% probability)

It selects "1."

**Step 5: Repeating the Process**
Now it predicts the next token after "1.":
- "What" (80% probability)
- "How" (12% probability)
- "Why" (5% probability)
- Other (3% probability)

It continues this process, generating one token at a time, until it produces a complete response.

**Step 6: You See the Output**
"1. What are the three main things plants need for photosynthesis?
2. How do plants use sunlight to make their own food?
3. Why are plants called 'producers' in the food chain?"

**Step 7: You Review and Decide**
You evaluate whether these questions are appropriate for your students, accurate, and aligned with your learning objectives. You might use them as-is, modify them, or ask ChatGPT to try again with a more specific prompt.

### Key Insights from This Process

**Insight 1:** ChatGPT doesn't "think" about photosynthesis. It recognizes patterns about how photosynthesis is typically discussed in educational contexts for 5th graders.

**Insight 2:** Each word depends on the words before it. This is why giving more context in your prompt leads to better outputs.

**Insight 3:** There's randomness involved. If you ask the same question twice, you might get slightly different responses (unless you set "temperature" to 0).

**Insight 4:** The model has no way to verify if the information is correct. It generates what is statistically likely based on its training data.

**Insight 5:** Your review is essential. You bring expertise about your students, your curriculum, and factual accuracy.
