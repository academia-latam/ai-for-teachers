## üìö Differentiation Prompts

### Text Adaptation to Multiple Levels

```
I'm teaching [grade level] students about [topic]. I have this text, but it's too [advanced/simple]:

[Paste the text you want adapted]

Please adapt this text to THREE reading levels:
1. [Grade X-Y] level for struggling readers
2. [Grade Z] level for on-grade students
3. [Grade Z+1 or Z+2] level for advanced readers

For each version:
- Keep the main ideas the same
- Adjust sentence length, vocabulary, and complexity appropriately
- Maintain factual accuracy
```

**Example:**
```
I'm teaching 4th grade students about photosynthesis. I have this text from a 6th grade science book, but it's too advanced:

"Photosynthesis is the biochemical process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. This process requires chlorophyll, carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to produce oxygen as a byproduct."

Please adapt this to THREE reading levels:
1. Grade 2-3 level for struggling readers
2. Grade 4 level for on-grade students
3. Grade 5-6 level for advanced readers

For each version, keep the main idea about how plants make food using sunlight.
