## Criterion 1: Prompt Quality (5 points)

Assesses the quality and effectiveness of the prompts used to generate AI content.

| Level | Points | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Exemplary** | 5 | Prompt is highly specific, includes all relevant context (grade level, subject, student needs, format, constraints). Shows evidence of iteration (follow-up prompts to refine output). Demonstrates strong understanding of how to communicate effectively with AI tools. |
| **Proficient** | 4 | Prompt includes most relevant context (grade level, topic, basic format). May lack some details about students or specific needs. Shows some iteration or refinement. |
| **Developing** | 3 | Prompt includes basic information (topic, grade level) but lacks specificity. Minimal or no follow-up prompts. Output would be improved with more detailed initial prompt. |
| **Beginning** | 2 | Prompt is vague or generic (e.g., "create a lesson plan about science"). Missing critical context like grade level or specific topic. No evidence of iteration. |
| **Incomplete** | 0-1 | Prompt not submitted, or so minimal that it doesn't provide meaningful assessment of skill. |

**What we're looking for:**
- ✅ Specific grade level and subject
- ✅ Clear description of desired output format
- ✅ Student context (abilities, challenges, interests)
- ✅ Specific components requested
- ✅ Evidence of follow-up prompts to refine output

## Criterion 2: Critical Evaluation & Editing (5 points)

Assesses your ability to critically review AI output and make appropriate edits.

| Level | Points | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Exemplary** | 5 | Edits demonstrate strong critical thinking and professional judgment. Changes are purposeful and well-justified (e.g., correcting errors, adjusting difficulty, adding cultural relevance, personalizing for specific students). Shows understanding of AI limitations. Edits significantly improve the quality and appropriateness of the content. |
| **Proficient** | 4 | Edits show good judgment. Makes appropriate changes to improve accuracy, tone, or relevance. May personalize content for students. Some missed opportunities for improvement, but overall demonstrates critical evaluation. |
| **Developing** | 3 | Makes some edits, but changes are minor or superficial (e.g., only fixing typos). May accept AI content too uncritically without checking for accuracy or appropriateness. Shows limited evidence of professional judgment. |
| **Beginning** | 2 | Minimal edits or edits that don't meaningfully improve the content. May use AI output nearly as-is without critical evaluation. Doesn't recognize errors or areas for improvement. |
| **Incomplete** | 0-1 | No edits made, or edited version not submitted. Uses AI content verbatim without review. |

**What we're looking for:**
- ✅ Factual corrections if AI made errors
- ✅ Adjustments to difficulty/reading level for actual students
- ✅ Personalization (local examples, student names, connections to prior lessons)
- ✅ Cultural responsiveness checks
- ✅ Alignment with learning objectives and standards
- ✅ Tone or language adjustments
- ✅ Evidence that you didn't just accept AI output uncritically

### Common Areas for Improvement (Feedback We Often Provide)

⚠️ **Prompt Quality:**
- *Too vague:* "Create a lesson plan" → Add grade, topic, components, student context
- *No iteration:* One prompt with no follow-ups → Try refining based on initial output
- *Missing student context:* AI doesn't know your students—tell it about their needs

⚠️ **Critical Evaluation:**
- *Uncritical acceptance:* Using AI output verbatim → Always review and personalize
- *Surface-level edits:* Only fixing typos → Think about accuracy, appropriateness, relevance
- *Missing fact-checks:* Not verifying factual claims → Always verify dates, definitions, formulas

⚠️ **Reflection:**
- *Generic statements:* "It was good" → Give specific examples of what worked or didn't
- *Too brief:* 1-sentence answers → Expand with details and examples (aim for 250-400 words total)
- *No connection to learning:* → Explain what you learned about AI capabilities/limitations

⚠️ **Professionalism:**
- *Disorganized:* Components not clearly labeled → Use headings and clear formatting
- *Missing components:* Only 2-3 of 4 submitted → Double-check before submitting
- *Late without communication:* → Request extension in advance if needed

## Sample Feedback Comments

### Exemplary Work (18-20 points)

> "Excellent work! Your prompts were highly specific and showed strong iteration—asking ChatGPT to make the activity more hands-on, then requesting differentiation was exactly right. Your edits were purposeful and demonstrated critical thinking: you corrected the date error in question 3, simplified vocabulary for your struggling readers, and added local references that made the content much more engaging for your students. Your reflection was honest and specific, especially your discussion of how question 10 fell flat in practice—that's valuable learning. You've demonstrated strong understanding of AI as a collaborative tool that requires human expertise. Well done!"

### Proficient Work (15-17 points)

> "Good work! Your prompt included important details like grade level and topic, and the AI-generated content was appropriate. Your edits improved the material—nice job simplifying the language and adding examples. To move to exemplary, consider: (1) trying follow-up prompts to refine the AI output before finalizing, (2) providing more specific examples in your reflection about what worked and why, and (3) connecting your experience more explicitly to Week 1 concepts like human-centered AI or responsible use. You're on the right track—keep iterating and reflecting deeply!"

### Developing Work (12-14 points)

> "You've completed the assignment, but there's room for growth. Your initial prompt was quite generic ('create discussion questions about the book'), which led to generic output. Next time, try adding: grade level, student context, specific question types you want, and connections to your curriculum. Your edits were minimal—mostly fixing typos. Challenge yourself to think critically: Are these questions appropriate for YOUR students? Is the difficulty right? How could you personalize them? Your reflection answered the questions but could be more specific—instead of 'it went well,' describe what students said or did that showed engagement. Revisit Week 1 content on prompt engineering and critical evaluation of AI outputs."

### Beginning or Incomplete Work (0-11 points)

> "This submission is missing key components [list what's missing]. To receive credit, you must submit all four parts: your prompt, the AI output, your edited version, and your reflection. Additionally, your [prompt/edits/reflection] needs more depth—[specific feedback]. Please review the assignment instructions and rubric, and if you have questions, reach out via email or the discussion forum. Consider resubmitting for partial credit (policies for late/revised work: [link to policy])."
