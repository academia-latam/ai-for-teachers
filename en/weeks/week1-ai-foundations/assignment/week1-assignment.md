---

## 📋 Assignment Requirements

### Part 1: Create (30-45 minutes)

Choose ONE of the following teaching tasks and use an AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) to create it:

**Option A: Lesson Plan or Lesson Component**
- Complete lesson plan for an upcoming topic (any subject, any grade)
- OR a specific lesson component: hook/anticipatory set, learning activity, closure activity

**Option B: Differentiated Materials**
- Adapt a text to 2-3 different reading levels
- Create scaffolded versions of an assignment
- Generate multilingual materials for ELL students

**Option C: Assessment**
- Formative assessment (exit ticket, quick quiz, think-pair-share questions)
- Summative assessment (test, project rubric, performance task)
- Discussion questions or Socratic seminar prompts

**Option D: Feedback or Communication**
- Parent communication email (about upcoming unit, field trip, classroom expectations)
- Student feedback templates
- Recommendation letter outline

**Option E: Administrative Task**
- Substitute lesson plan
- Meeting agenda or notes summary
- Organization system for classroom materials

---

### Part 2: Use (Variable time - depends on what you created)

**Actually use your AI-generated resource in your teaching this week.**

- If you created a lesson, teach it
- If you created differentiated materials, use them with students
- If you created an assessment, administer it
- If you created communication, send it
- If you created a substitute plan, have it ready

**Document the experience:**
- How did it go?
- How did students respond (if applicable)?
- What worked well?
- What would you change?

---

### Part 3: Reflect (15-20 minutes)

Answer the reflection questions (provided in submission template).

---

## 📤 What to Submit

Submit a document (PDF, Google Doc link, or Word doc) containing ALL four components:

### Component 1: Your Prompt(s)

**Include the exact prompt(s) you used.**

Example:
```
Prompt 1 (initial):
Create a 45-minute lesson plan for 6th grade students on the water cycle. Include a hook, direct instruction, an activity, and an assessment.

Prompt 2 (follow-up):
Can you make the activity more hands-on? My students learn best by doing, not just reading or watching.

Prompt 3 (refinement):
Can you add differentiation for students who struggle with reading? Maybe include a graphic organizer or visual supports.
```

**Why we need this:** Seeing your prompts helps us assess your prompt engineering skills and give you feedback on how to improve.

---

### Component 2: AI-Generated Output

**Copy and paste the AI-generated content exactly as it was created.**

Use formatting to make it clear this is the AI version:

> **AI OUTPUT:**
>
> [Paste the complete output from ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini here]

**Why we need this:** We want to see what the AI produced before your edits, so we can evaluate how well you're using the tool and how critically you're reviewing outputs.

---

### Component 3: Your Final, Edited Version

**Provide the version you actually used in your classroom** (with your edits, additions, and personalization).

Use a different format or color to distinguish from the AI version:

**MY EDITED VERSION:**

[Your final version here, with edits/additions highlighted or noted]

**Optional but recommended:** Use comments, highlights, or a different font color to show what you changed from the AI version.

**Why we need this:** This shows us your professional judgment—how you adapted the AI output for your specific students and context.

---

(3-4 sentences)

**4. How did it go when you used this in your teaching?**
What was the impact on students, your time, or your teaching practice?
(3-4 sentences)

**5. What did you learn about using AI for teaching through this experience?**
What surprised you? What would you do differently next time?
(2-3 sentences)

**6. How likely are you to use AI for similar tasks in the future?**
- [ ] Very likely—this saved me significant time and improved quality
- [ ] Likely—useful for some tasks but not all

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Writing Strong Prompts
- ✅ Include grade level, subject, and specific topic
- ✅ Describe your students (reading levels, interests, challenges)
- ✅ Specify format and components you want
- ✅ Give examples if possible
- ✅ Don't be afraid to iterate—use follow-up prompts to refine

### Editing AI Output
- ✅ Always read the entire output before using
- ✅ Fact-check any specific claims (dates, definitions, formulas)
- ✅ Add your personal touch (local references, student names, inside jokes)
- ✅ Check for cultural responsiveness and bias
- ✅ Ensure alignment with your learning objectives and standards
- ✅ Adjust difficulty level based on your actual students

### Reflecting Meaningfully
- ✅ Be honest—if something didn't work, say so and explain why
- ✅ Give specific examples rather than vague statements
- ✅ Connect to Week 1's content (UNESCO principles, human-centered AI, LLM limitations)
- ✅ Think beyond this one task—what did you learn about AI use in general?

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Using AI output without any editing or review
- ❌ Not actually using the resource in your teaching (we can tell!)
- ❌ Generic reflection that could apply to anyone's experience
- ❌ Submitting only 1-2 components instead of all 4
- ❌ Vague prompts that don't give the AI enough context

## 🤔 FAQs

**Q: What if the AI-generated content was perfect and I didn't need to edit it?**
A: Highly unlikely, but if this genuinely happens, explain in your reflection why it was appropriate as-is. Even small personalizations (adding student names, local examples) count as edits.

**Q: Can I use the same resource I created during Week 1's "First Teaching Prompt" activity?**
A: Yes, but only if you actually use it in your teaching this week and complete the full reflection. The assignment requires real classroom implementation.

**Q: What if I don't have a teaching assignment this week (e.g., I'm on break or not currently teaching)?**
A: Create something you'll use when you return to teaching, or create a hypothetical resource and do a "dry run" with a colleague or family member acting as students. Note this in your reflection.

**Q: Can I collaborate with another teacher taking this course?**
A: You can discuss ideas and share prompts, but each person must submit their own unique resource and reflection. No identical submissions.

**Q: What if my district blocks ChatGPT?**
A: Use Claude (claude.ai) or Google Gemini (gemini.google.com). Both are free and work similarly. Or ask your tech coordinator if there's a district-approved AI tool.

**Q: How long should my reflection be?**
A: 250-400 words total across all 6 questions. That's roughly 1-1.5 pages double-spaced. Quality over quantity—be specific and thoughtful.

**Q: What if the AI made errors and I used incorrect information in my teaching?**
A: Be honest in your reflection—this is a learning experience. Explain what happened, how you discovered the error, and what you learned about the importance of verification. You will NOT be penalized for mistakes as long as you reflect critically.

**Q: Can I submit a video reflection instead of written?**
A: Yes! If you prefer to reflect via video (3-4 minutes), that's acceptable. Upload to YouTube/Vimeo (unlisted) and provide the link. Still include Components 1-3 as text.

### Component 3: My Edited Version

**MY EDITED VERSION:**

Here are 10 discussion questions for Chapter 1 of *To Kill a Mockingbird*:

**Comprehension Questions:** *(I kept these mostly as-is but simplified #2)*
1. Who is narrating the story, and what do we learn about her family?
2. Describe Maycomb. What kind of town is it? *(Simplified from AI version)*
3. Who is Boo Radley, and what do the neighborhood kids say about him?

**Analysis Questions:** *(I kept #4-6 but rewrote #7 to be more specific)*
4. Why did Harper Lee choose Scout, looking back as an adult, to tell this childhood story?
5. What does Maycomb's description tell us about the setting and time period?
6. What might the Radley house symbolize to Scout, Jem, and Dill?
7. **[CHANGED]** Dill is an outsider who just arrived in Maycomb. How does his presence change the way Scout and Jem think about their town? *(More specific than AI's version)*

**Modern Connections:** *(I significantly edited these to connect to our recent current events discussions)*
8. **[CHANGED]** The kids make up scary stories about Boo Radley based on rumors. Think about the recent TikTok trend we discussed where rumors spread about a local person. How are these situations similar? What's dangerous about believing stories without evidence?
9. **[CHANGED]** Maycomb was struggling economically during the Great Depression. We've talked about how [our city] faced budget cuts last year. How might economic stress affect the way a community treats outsiders or people who are different?

**Reflection Question:** *(I made this more open-ended)*
10. **[CHANGED]** Scout describes Maycomb as "tired" and slow-moving. Based on this description, what do you predict might happen in this story?

### Component 4: Reflection

**1. What did you create, and why did you choose this task?**
I created discussion questions for Chapter 1 of *To Kill a Mockingbird* because I'm teaching this novel next week and wanted questions that would push beyond basic comprehension to help students connect themes to their own lives.

**2. How did the AI-generated content compare to what you would have created on your own?**
Honestly, the AI questions were comparable to what I would have written—solid, literature-class standard questions. The AI was faster (30 seconds vs. 15-20 minutes for me), but the questions felt a bit generic. The "modern connections" were decent starting points but needed to be tailored to my specific students and our recent classroom conversations.

**3. What edits did you make to the AI output, and why?**
I made three main types of edits: (1) Simplified language for a few questions since some of my students read below grade level, (2) Made question #7 more specific to focus on Dill's outsider status, which connects to our unit theme of belonging, and (3) Completely rewrote the modern connection questions to reference specific current events and local issues we've discussed in class. The AI couldn't know about the TikTok rumor situation we'd talked about or our city's budget issues, so I added that context to make the questions more relevant and engaging for my students.

**4. How did it go when you used this in your teaching?**
The discussion went really well! Students engaged deeply, especially with questions 8 and 9 (the modern connections I edited). Several students made the connection between Boo Radley rumors and how quickly misinformation spreads online. Question 7 about Dill being an outsider led to a great conversation about how new perspectives can help us see our own communities differently. The comprehension questions were useful for making sure everyone understood the basics, but the analysis and connection questions were where the real learning happened. I did notice that question 10 (the prediction question) fell flat—students weren't sure what to predict yet. Next time I'd save that for after Chapter 3-4.

**5. What did you learn about using AI for teaching through this experience?**
I learned that AI is excellent for creating drafts and providing structure, but my expertise is essential for making content relevant and meaningful to my specific students. The AI gave me a strong foundation in minutes, but the questions only became truly effective when I added context about my students' lives, our ongoing discussions, and their reading levels. I also realized I need to verify that AI-suggested discussion prompts will actually work in practice—question 10 seemed good on paper but didn't spark discussion.

**6. How likely are you to use AI for similar tasks in the future?**
[X] Very likely—this saved me significant time and improved quality

I'll definitely use AI for discussion questions again. It cut my planning time from 20 minutes to about 5 minutes (30 seconds for AI to generate + 4-5 minutes for me to edit and personalize). The time savings were real, and the quality was actually better than if I'd done it alone because the AI gave me ideas I might not have thought of (like question 4 about narrative perspective), which I then refined. I see this as a collaborative tool—AI provides breadth of ideas quickly, and I provide depth of understanding about my students.
