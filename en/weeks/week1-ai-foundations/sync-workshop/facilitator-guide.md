### 0:05-0:15 | Icebreaker Discussion (10 min)

**Activity: "Hopes, Fears, and First Impressions"**

**Setup (2 min):**
> "Let's start by hearing from you. I'm going to put you in breakout rooms of 3-4 people for 8 minutes. In your groups, introduce yourselves briefly—name, what you teach—and then discuss these three questions:
>
> 1. **Hope:** What's one thing you're excited about regarding AI in education?
> 2. **Fear:** What's one concern or worry you have?
> 3. **First Impression:** After completing Week 1's content and trying ChatGPT, what surprised you most?
>
> Choose someone to take a few notes—we'll share highlights when we return to the main room. Questions before I send you to breakout rooms?"

**Breakout Rooms (8 min):**
- Randomly assign participants to groups of 3-4
- Set 8-minute timer
- Visit rooms briefly as facilitator to check engagement
- Give 1-minute warning before closing rooms

**Debrief (2 min):**
> "Welcome back! Let's hear some highlights. I'll call on a few groups. Give me one hope, one fear, or one surprise your group discussed."

**Facilitate 3-4 responses. Acknowledge common themes:**

> "Great, I'm hearing some common themes:
> - **Hopes:** Time savings, better differentiation, staying current with technology
> - **Fears:** Student cheating, over-reliance on AI, privacy concerns, inaccuracy
> - **Surprises:** How easy it is to use, how much AI is already in our lives, quality of outputs
>
> We'll address many of these today, and even more in Weeks 3 and 5. Let's keep moving."

**Facilitator Tip:** Validate all fears and concerns. Never dismiss worry as unfounded—acknowledge it and note when it will be addressed in the course.

### 0:15-0:30 | Live Demo: ChatGPT for Teachers (15 min)

**Activity: Interactive ChatGPT Demonstration**

**Materials:**
- ChatGPT open in browser (logged in)
- 3-4 pre-planned teaching prompts
- Screen share enabled

**Setup (1 min):**
> "Now I'm going to show you ChatGPT in action with real teaching scenarios. I'll demonstrate three different prompts, and for each, we'll talk through what works and what doesn't. I want this to be interactive—feel free to type suggestions in the chat as we go."

---

**Demo Example 1: Lesson Planning (5 min)**

**Scenario:**
> "Let's say I teach 4th grade and I'm planning a lesson on fractions—specifically, adding fractions with unlike denominators. My students struggle with finding common denominators."

**Show vague prompt first:**
Type in ChatGPT: `Create a lesson plan about adding fractions.`

**Wait for output, then say:**
> "Okay, ChatGPT gave me a generic lesson plan. It's fine, but it's not specific to my students or my needs. Watch what happens when I give more context."

**Now show improved prompt:**
```
Create a 45-minute lesson plan for 4th grade students on adding fractions with unlike denominators.

Include:
- A real-world hook (maybe using pizza or recipe examples)
- Direct instruction on finding common denominators with visual models
- Guided practice with 3 problems we can work through together
- Independent practice with 5 problems at varying difficulty levels
- A quick exit ticket to assess understanding

Context: My students are in a suburban public school, mixed abilities. Many struggle with multiplication facts, which makes finding common denominators hard. Include fraction strips or visual models to support understanding.
```

**Wait for output.**

**Debrief:**
> "Much better, right? Notice how specific details led to a more useful output. ChatGPT included:
> - A pizza hook that 4th graders would enjoy
> - Visual models (fraction strips)
> - Scaffolded problems
> - Even tips for students who struggle with multiplication
>
> **Key takeaway:** Specific context = better outputs. Tell the AI about your students, your constraints, your goals."

**Ask participants:**
> "In the chat, what else could I have added to make this prompt even better? What information might ChatGPT still be missing?"

**Acknowledge 2-3 chat responses** (e.g., time of year, prior lessons, specific standards, student interests).

---

**Demo Example 2: Differentiation (4 min)**

**Scenario:**
> "Now let's say I have a text I want to use for a history lesson, but it's written at an 8th grade level and I teach 5th grade. Plus, I have some ELL students who need even more support."

**Show prompt:**
```
I'm teaching 5th graders about the American colonies. I have this text [paste short paragraph about colonial life], but it's too advanced.

Please adapt this text to THREE reading levels:
1. Grade 3-4 level for struggling readers
2. Grade 5 level for on-grade students
3. Original text with vocabulary supports for advanced readers

For each version, keep the main ideas the same but adjust sentence length, vocabulary, and complexity.
```

**Paste a sample paragraph (or use pre-written one):**
> "The thirteen American colonies were established along the Atlantic coast between 1607 and 1733. These colonies developed distinct regional characteristics: the New England colonies focused on trade and shipbuilding, the Middle colonies became known as the 'breadbasket' due to agricultural production, and the Southern colonies relied heavily on plantation agriculture and slave labor."

**Wait for output.**

**Debrief:**
> "Look at this—ChatGPT created three versions in seconds. The Grade 3-4 version uses simpler words like 'started' instead of 'established' and breaks ideas into shorter sentences. The Grade 5 version is clearer than the original. And the advanced version adds vocabulary definitions.
>
> **Could I use this as-is Monday?** Maybe! I'd want to check:
> ✓ Are the facts still accurate? (Yes, they are)
> ✓ Do the simplified versions still convey the key concepts? (Mostly—I might tweak the southern colonies description)
> ✓ Are the vocabulary supports appropriate? (Yes)
>
> **Key takeaway:** AI excels at text adaptation and differentiation. This task might take you 30 minutes manually—AI did it in 15 seconds. You still review and edit, but you save significant time."

---

**Demo Example 3: Assessment Creation (3 min)**

**Scenario:**
> "Finally, let's create a quick formative assessment—an exit ticket."

**Show prompt:**
```
Create a 3-question exit ticket for 5th graders who just learned about adding fractions with unlike denominators.

Include:
- 1 basic problem (straightforward, like 1/2 + 1/4)
- 1 moderate problem (requires more thinking, like 2/3 + 1/6)
- 1 reflection question (asking students to explain the process in their own words)

Keep it short—students should be able to complete this in 3-5 minutes.
```

**Wait for output.**

**Debrief:**
> "Perfect! This is exactly what I needed. I can print this or put it on a Google Form.
>
> **Notice:** I specified difficulty levels, time constraint, and even asked for a reflection question to assess deeper understanding, not just procedural skill.
>
> **Key takeaway:** AI can generate assessments quickly, but YOU decide what kind of understanding you're assessing and what rigor is appropriate."

---

**Wrap-Up Demo (2 min):**
> "Three examples, three different teaching tasks—all done in about 10 minutes. The time savings are real.
>
> **But remember:**
> ⚠️ You're the expert—always review outputs
> ⚠️ Check for factual accuracy (AI can make mistakes)
> ⚠️ Ensure cultural responsiveness (AI doesn't know your students)
> ⚠️ Add your personal touch (inside jokes, local references, connections to previous lessons)
>
> Now it's your turn to practice!"

---

### 0:30-0:45 | Hands-On: Prompt Writing Workshop (15 min)

**Activity: Guided Prompt Practice**

**Setup (2 min):**
> "Open ChatGPT (or Claude or Gemini) on your device. You're going to write and test a prompt right now. Here's your challenge:
>
> **Your task:** Create something you'll actually use in your teaching next week. Options:
> 1. A lesson hook or anticipatory set
> 2. A set of discussion questions
> 3. A differentiated reading passage
> 4. A formative assessment
> 5. Parent communication email
>
> **You have 10 minutes.** Use the prompt template I'll drop in the chat."

**Post in chat:**
```
PROMPT TEMPLATE:

[Create/Generate/Write] a [specific format] for [grade level] students on [specific topic].

Include:
- [Component 1]
- [Component 2]
- [Component 3]

Context about my students: [relevant details]

[Any additional constraints: time, style, etc.]
```

**Individual Work (10 min):**
- Participants work independently
- Facilitator and co-facilitator monitor chat for questions
- Offer help to anyone stuck
- Give time warnings at 5 min and 2 min remaining

**Facilitator moves around (if virtual, monitor chat; if in-person, circulate)**

**Pair Share (3 min):**
> "Find a partner (use breakout rooms or chat to pair up). You have 3 minutes to share:
> 1. What you created
> 2. How well it worked (did you need to revise your prompt?)
> 3. Will you actually use it?
>
> Go!"

**3-minute timer. Close breakout rooms.**

**Quick Debrief (1 min):**
> "Quick show of hands or reaction in chat:
> - How many of you got something usable on your first try? 👍
> - How many had to revise your prompt at least once? 👍
> - How many plan to actually use what you created? 👍
>
> Excellent! Iteration is normal. Even experts refine prompts multiple times."

### 0:45-1:00 | Guided Discussion: Ethics & Trust (15 min)

**Activity: Facilitated Conversation About AI Ethics**

**Setup (1 min):**
> "AI is powerful, but it's not neutral. Let's talk about the elephant in the room: When is it okay to use AI, and when is it not? What are the ethical guardrails?"

**Discussion Question 1: Student Cheating & Academic Integrity (5 min)**

> "Raise your hand or drop in chat: How many of you are worried about students using ChatGPT to cheat on assignments?"

**Acknowledge responses.**

> "This is the #1 concern teachers have. Let's talk through it. Here's a provocative question: Is students using ChatGPT fundamentally different from students using Google, or getting help from a tutor, or collaborating with a peer?
>
> I'll give you 2 minutes in breakout rooms. Discuss: Where's the line between 'acceptable help' and 'cheating' when it comes to AI?"

**Breakout rooms (2 min).**

**Debrief (3 min):**
> "What did your groups conclude? Anyone want to share?"

**Facilitate 2-3 responses.**

**Facilitator provides framing:**
> "Here's one way to think about it: The issue isn't the tool; it's the learning goal.
>
> - If the assignment is to *practice* writing a persuasive essay, having ChatGPT write it for you defeats the purpose. That's cheating.
> - If the assignment is to *analyze* a topic and you use ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas, then write the essay yourself, that's acceptable help—similar to talking to a classmate.
>
> **Key question:** Does using AI prevent the student from achieving the learning objective, or does it support them toward the objective?
>
> **What can we do?**
> - Be explicit with students about when AI use is allowed vs. not allowed
> - Design assignments that require personal voice, local context, or critical thinking that AI can't replicate
> - Teach students how to use AI ethically (we'll cover this in Week 5!)
> - Focus on process, not just product (ask students to show drafts, explain their thinking)"

---

**Discussion Question 2: Bias and Equity (4 min)**

> "AI learns from data—often scraped from the internet, which contains biases. This means AI can reproduce racist, sexist, or culturally insensitive content.
>
> **Question:** Have any of you noticed bias or cultural insensitivity in AI outputs? Share in chat or speak up."

**Pause for responses (1 min).**

**Examples to mention if participants don't share:**
- Image generators depicting 'professional' as white men
- Language models using stereotypes when asked about certain nationalities
- AI writing tools penalizing non-standard English dialects
- AI struggling with names from non-Western cultures

**Facilitator:**
> "This is why the UNESCO human-centered mindset matters. YOU are the check on bias. When you use AI, ask:
> - Would this content be appropriate for all my students, regardless of race, culture, language, or ability?
> - Does this reflect diverse perspectives, or just dominant cultural narratives?
> - Am I perpetuating stereotypes by using this uncritically?
>
> **Actionable practice:** When you generate content with AI, do a 'bias check' before using it. Ask yourself: Who is represented? Who is missing? Who might be harmed by this?"

---

**Discussion Question 3: Privacy & Data (3 min)**

> "Final ethical issue: Student data privacy. When you type something into ChatGPT, that data may be stored and used to train future models—unless you're using a paid, privacy-compliant version.
>
> **Golden rule:** Never put identifiable student information (names, IDs, photos) into AI tools unless the tool is FERPA-compliant and approved by your district.
>
> **Safe practices:**
> - Use fictional names when creating examples
> - Describe student needs generically ('I have a student who struggles with reading' rather than 'Jamal in period 3')
> - Check your district's approved AI tools list
> - If using free ChatGPT, treat it like a public space—don't share anything you wouldn't post on social media
>
> **Questions about privacy?**"

**Pause for questions (1 min).**

---

**Wrap Ethics Discussion (1 min):**
> "These ethical considerations aren't meant to scare you away from AI—they're meant to make you thoughtful users. The UNESCO framework gives us the principles; you apply them in context. Week 5 goes much deeper into this. For now, trust your professional judgment and err on the side of caution."

---

### 1:00-1:10 | Q&A (10 min)

**Open Floor for Questions**

**Facilitator:**
> "We have 10 minutes for any questions—about Week 1 content, the assignment, using AI tools, anything. What's on your mind?"

**Common Questions to Anticipate:**

**Q: "Do I need the paid version of ChatGPT?"**
A: "No, the free version (GPT-3.5) is sufficient for most teaching tasks. The paid version (GPT-4) is more powerful and accurate, but not required for this course."

**Q: "What if my district blocks ChatGPT?"**
A: "Check if they have an approved alternative (some districts use Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, or education-specific tools like MagicSchool AI). If all AI tools are blocked, talk to your tech coordinator—show them this course's UNESCO alignment and ethical framework. AI literacy is becoming essential for teachers."

**Q: "Can I use AI-generated content without citing it?"**
A: "If you're creating materials for your classroom (lesson plans, handouts), you don't need to cite AI—you're the author using a tool. BUT, be transparent with students and colleagues if asked. If you're publishing or presenting materials externally, check the venue's AI citation guidelines."

**Q: "What if the AI generates something incorrect and I don't catch it?"**
A: "This is why review is essential. For factual content (science, history, math), always verify claims, especially if you're not an expert in that area. Cross-reference with reliable sources. Over time, you'll develop intuition for when AI is more vs. less reliable."

**Q: "How do I know if my prompt is good?"**
A: "If the output is what you needed, your prompt was good! If not, revise. There's no 'perfect' prompt—it's about iteration. Week 2 will dive deeper into prompt engineering strategies."

**Address all participant questions until time runs out or no more questions remain.**

### Facilitation Tips

**1. Time Management:**
- Use a visible timer for each activity
- Give "2-minute" and "1-minute" warnings for group work
- Be willing to cut Q&A short if earlier sections run long
- Prioritize hands-on practice over extended lecture

**2. Engagement Strategies:**
- Use chat actively—ask for reactions, thumbs up, questions
- Call on quieter participants gently: "I'd love to hear from someone who hasn't shared yet"
- Validate all contributions, especially concerns or fears about AI
- Use breakout rooms frequently to increase participation

**3. Technical Troubleshooting:**
- Have co-facilitator ready to help with tech issues via chat
- If screen share fails, have backup plan (describe prompts verbally)
- If ChatGPT is slow, have pre-generated outputs ready as backup

**4. Handling Difficult Questions:**
- If you don't know the answer, say so: "Great question—I don't know off the top of my head. Let me research and follow up in the forum."
- If a question is off-topic, defer: "That's important but beyond our scope today. Let's discuss in the forum or during office hours."
- If a participant is resistant to AI, validate their concerns: "I hear you—there are legitimate concerns. The goal of this course is to help you make informed decisions, not to force AI adoption."

**5. Inclusive Facilitation:**
- Use participants' names when responding
- Acknowledge diverse teaching contexts (elementary vs. secondary, STEM vs. humanities, public vs. private)
- Offer multiple ways to participate (chat, voice, breakout discussions)
- Be mindful of time zones if running multiple workshop sessions

---

### Participant Engagement Strategies

**For the Skeptic:**
Acknowledge concerns, provide evidence, invite experimentation without pressure.
> "I hear your concern about AI inaccuracy. That's valid. This course will teach you how to verify outputs and use AI responsibly. Try the assignment with a low-stakes task—see how it works for you before deciding."

**For the Overly Enthusiastic:**
Channel energy productively, remind about ethics and human judgment.
> "I love your enthusiasm! As you experiment, remember the ethical guardrails we discussed—always review outputs and maintain your professional agency."

**For the Confused/Overwhelmed:**
Offer step-by-step support, normalize struggle, point to resources.
> "It's okay to feel overwhelmed—this is new! Start small. Just try creating one thing this week. Check out the FAQ document if you get stuck, and ask questions in the forum. We're here to support you."

**For the Silent Observer:**
Gently invite participation without pressure.
> "I notice some folks haven't shared yet—anyone else have a reaction or question? No pressure, but we'd love to hear from you."
