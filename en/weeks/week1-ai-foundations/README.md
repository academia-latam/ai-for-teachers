## üéØ Why This Week Matters

Before diving into practical applications, it's crucial to understand:

1. **What AI can and cannot do** - Realistic expectations prevent disappointment and misuse
2. **How AI "thinks"** - Understanding LLMs helps you write better prompts
3. **Your role as the expert** - AI assists; you decide, evaluate, and adapt
4. **Ethical foundations** - Human-centered approach ensures AI serves students, not algorithms

**Remember:** This week is about building a strong foundation. Take your time, ask questions, and experiment. There are no "wrong" prompts‚Äîonly learning opportunities!
