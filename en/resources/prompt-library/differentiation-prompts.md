## üìñ Reading Level Adaptation

### Text Simplification (Multiple Levels)

```
I'm teaching [grade level] students about [topic]. I have this text, but I need it adapted for different reading levels:

[Paste original text]

Please create THREE versions:

**Version 1: [Grade X-Y] reading level** (for struggling readers)
- Simpler vocabulary (replace complex words with common alternatives)
- Shorter sentences (max 10-12 words per sentence)
- More concrete examples
- [Optional: Add visual cue suggestions]

**Version 2: [Grade Z] reading level** (on-grade level)
- Grade-appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure
- Clear and accessible
- Maintains key concepts

**Version 3: [Grade Z+2] reading level** (for advanced readers)
- More sophisticated vocabulary
- Complex sentence structures
- Additional details or connections
- [Optional: Include extension questions]

Important: All versions must convey the same core information and key facts.
```

**Example:**
```
I'm teaching 6th grade students about the water cycle. I have this text from a high school textbook, but I need it adapted:

"The hydrologic cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the Earth's surface. Evaporation, driven by solar radiation, converts liquid water into water vapor. This vapor ascends into the atmosphere, where it undergoes condensation to form clouds. Precipitation occurs when water droplets coalesce and become too heavy to remain suspended, returning water to the surface."

Please create THREE versions:

Version 1: Grade 3-4 reading level (for students with reading challenges)
Version 2: Grade 6 reading level (on-grade)
Version 3: Grade 7-8 reading level (for advanced readers)

Important: All versions must explain evaporation, condensation, and precipitation accurately.
```

1. [X] visual supports to add (diagrams, charts, graphic organizers, images)
2. Key vocabulary words to bold or highlight
3. Text features to include (headings, captions, labeled diagrams)
4. Where to place visuals for maximum support

Describe each visual suggestion specifically enough that I could create or find it.

Student context: [ELL students / students with learning disabilities / visual learners / etc.]
```

---

### Chunking Long Texts

```
This [passage/article/chapter] is [X] paragraphs/pages long, which is overwhelming for some of my [grade level] students.

[Paste text or describe it]

Please:
1. Break it into [X] manageable chunks
2. Create a focus question or purpose statement for each chunk
3. Suggest stopping points for comprehension checks
4. Recommend a graphic organizer to help students track information across chunks

Goal: Help students process the information without getting lost or overwhelmed.

## ‚ôø Universal Design for Learning (UDL)

### Multiple Means of Representation

```
I'm teaching [topic] to [grade level] students. Currently, I present information primarily through [lecture/reading/video/etc.].

Help me offer multiple means of representation by suggesting:
1. An alternative way to present the information visually
2. An alternative way to present the information through text/reading
3. An alternative way to present the information aurally/verbally
4. A hands-on or kinesthetic option

All options should convey the same core content about [topic] but through different modalities.

Learning goal: [What students should understand or be able to do]
Available resources: [Tech, materials, time, space]
```

---

### Multiple Means of Engagement

```
Create [X] options for students to engage with learning about [topic] that appeal to different interests and motivations.

Include options that:
- Connect to different student interests ([list interests if known])
- Vary in social structure (independent, partner, small group)
- Offer different levels of challenge
- Include choice in content, process, or product

All options should lead to the same learning goal: [State goal]

Context: [Grade, subject, what you know about student interests and motivation]
```

---

### Multiple Means of Expression

```
Students need to demonstrate understanding of [topic/skill].

Instead of just [current assessment method, e.g., "written essay"], create [X] alternative ways students could show what they know:

Include a mix of:
- Written options (but varied formats)
- Visual/artistic options
- Oral/presentation options
- Technology-based options
- Hands-on/performance options

For each option, provide:
- Brief description of the task
- What students must include/demonstrate
- Suggested rubric criteria
- Estimated time needed

All options should assess the same core learning goal: [State goal]

Student context: [Diverse learning needs, strengths, available resources]
```

---

## üéØ Learning Style Differentiation

### Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic (VAK) Options

```
Create three versions of this learning activity on [topic] for [grade level], each optimized for a different learning style:

Original activity: [Describe activity]

**Visual Learners:**
- Emphasize charts, diagrams, color-coding, videos, graphic organizers
- Use visual metaphors and spatial organization
- Minimize heavy text

**Auditory Learners:**
- Emphasize discussion, verbal explanation, listening activities
- Include opportunities to talk through ideas
- Use rhythm, music, or mnemonic devices if appropriate

**Kinesthetic Learners:**
- Emphasize movement, hands-on manipulation, building/creating
- Include physical activity or tactile elements
- Allow students to "do" rather than just watch or listen

All three should teach the same content and achieve the same learning goal.

Learning objective: [State objective]
```

---

## üìä Data-Driven Differentiation

### Differentiation Based on Assessment Results

```
I just gave my [grade level] students an assessment on [topic]. Here are the results:

- [X]% of students mastered the content (scored 85%+)
- [X]% of students are approaching mastery (scored 70-84%)
- [X]% of students are struggling (scored below 70%)

Common errors/misconceptions:
1. [Error 1]
2. [Error 2]

Create a differentiated small group instruction plan:

**Group 1 (Mastered):**
- Extension activity that goes deeper or broader
- More complex application
- Independent or self-directed

**Group 2 (Approaching):**
- Targeted practice on [specific skills]
- Additional examples and guided practice
- Formative checks

**Group 3 (Struggling):**
- Reteaching of foundational concepts
- More scaffolding and support
- Manipulatives, visuals, or concrete models
- Smaller chunks with frequent checks

Time available: [X] minutes per group
Resources: [What you have available]
```

---

### Pre-Assessment Based Grouping

```
I'm about to start a unit on [topic] with my [grade level] students. I gave a pre-assessment and identified:

- [X] students with strong prior knowledge (they already know [concepts])
- [X] students with some prior knowledge (they know [concepts] but not [concepts])
- [X] students with little/no prior knowledge (starting from scratch)

Help me plan differentiated instruction:

1. Suggested pacing/content for each group during the first week
2. Specific activities or focuses for each group
3. How/when to bring groups together for whole-class instruction
4. How to ensure all students are challenged but not frustrated

Unit overview: [Briefly describe what the unit covers]
Length: [X] weeks
End goal: [What all students should know/be able to do by the end]
```

---

## üß© Interest-Based Differentiation

### Student Interest Integration

```
I'm teaching [topic] to [grade level] students. I surveyed them and found these interests:

[List student interests: sports, video games, art, music, social media, animals, etc.]

Create [X] ways to incorporate these interests into learning about [topic]:

For each suggestion:
- Connect the interest authentically to the content (not just superficial)
- Describe the activity or task
- Explain how it teaches the key concepts
- Suggest materials needed

Learning objectives: [What students need to learn]
```

---

### Current Events Connections

```
Create differentiated current events connections for teaching [topic] to [grade level].

Provide [X] different current event examples at varying complexity levels:

**Level 1 (Approaching):**
- Local, concrete, immediately relatable events
- Clear, direct connection to topic

**Level 2 (On-Level):**
- Regional or national events
- Moderate complexity

**Level 3 (Advanced):**
- Global or more abstract connections
- Requires synthesis and analysis

For each level, include:
- Brief description of the event
- How it connects to [topic]
- 2-3 discussion questions or analysis tasks

Topic being taught: [Specific topic]
```

## üí° Tips for Effective Differentiation with AI

### 1. Be Specific About Student Needs
Instead of: "Differentiate this for special ed"
Try: "Adapt for students who struggle with reading comprehension at 3rd grade level, need visual supports, and benefit from shorter task chunks"

### 2. Maintain Rigor
- ‚úÖ All versions should be challenging and respectful
- ‚úÖ Avoid "dumbing down"‚Äîsimplify language but keep content rich
- ‚úÖ Same learning goals, different paths

### 3. Request Specific Supports
Instead of: "Add scaffolding"
Try: "Include sentence frames, a graphic organizer template, and a word bank"

### 4. Consider Multiple Dimensions
Differentiate by:
- **Readiness** (current skill level)
- **Interest** (student motivation and preferences)
- **Learning profile** (how students learn best)
- **Language** (English proficiency, home language)

### 5. Always Review for Appropriateness
- ‚úÖ Check that simplified versions don't include errors
- ‚úÖ Ensure all versions are culturally responsive
- ‚úÖ Verify that supports actually match your students' needs

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Considerations

### What AI Does Well
- ‚úÖ Quickly generating multiple versions of texts or activities
- ‚úÖ Suggesting visual supports and organizational structures
- ‚úÖ Creating sentence frames and word banks
- ‚úÖ Offering variety and options

### What AI Needs Your Expertise For
- üéØ **Knowing your specific students** - AI gives generic supports; you know exactly what Jose or Maria needs
- üéØ **Cultural responsiveness** - Checking that examples and language are appropriate for your students' backgrounds
- üéØ **Appropriate difficulty** - Verifying that "Grade 3 level" matches your actual 3rd grade students' abilities
- üéØ **Integration with your teaching** - Connecting differentiated materials to your classroom routines and previous lessons

### Differentiation is Not
- ‚ùå Just "more" or "less" work
- ‚ùå Different learning objectives for different students
- ‚ùå Permanent grouping or tracking
- ‚ùå One-size-fits-all accommodations

### Differentiation Is
- ‚úÖ Multiple pathways to the same rigorous goal
- ‚úÖ Responsive to ongoing assessment
- ‚úÖ Flexible grouping based on needs
- ‚úÖ Respectful of all learners

---

## üöÄ Advanced Differentiation Prompts

### Flexible Grouping Plan

```
Create a flexible grouping plan for my [grade level] [subject] class during a unit on [topic].

Class composition:
- Total students: [X]
- [X] students reading below grade level
- [X] English language learners ([proficiency levels])
- [X] students with IEPs for [learning disabilities]
- [X] gifted/high-achieving students

Unit length: [X] weeks
Unit goals: [Key learning objectives]

Provide:
1. Suggested grouping structures (when to use whole class, small groups, partners, independent)
2. Criteria for forming groups (skill-based, interest-based, mixed, etc.)
3. How often to reassess and regroup
4. Specific differentiation strategies for each group configuration

Balance: Ensure all students experience appropriate challenge and support without feeling "tracked."
```

### Compacting Curriculum for Advanced Learners

```
I have [X] students in my [grade level] class who already demonstrate mastery of [topic/unit].

Unit overview: [Briefly describe the unit most students will complete]
Unit length: [X] weeks
Standards addressed: [List standards]

Create a compacted curriculum plan:
1. Pre-assessment to document mastery (what they already know)
2. Areas they still need to learn (if any)
3. Accelerated pacing through remaining content
4. Extension/enrichment activities to replace already-mastered content
5. How to ensure they're challenged but not just given "more work"

Extensions should:
- Go deeper or broader, not just faster
- Encourage independent learning skills
- Connect to authentic applications or real-world problems
```
