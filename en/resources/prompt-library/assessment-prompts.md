## üí° Assessment Design Tips

### Writing Better Prompts for Assessments

**1. Be specific about question types**
- ‚úÖ "Create 5 multiple choice questions with 4 options each, including plausible distractors based on common student errors"
- ‚ùå "Create some quiz questions"

**2. Include learning objectives**
- ‚úÖ "Students should be able to identify cause-and-effect relationships in historical events"
- ‚ùå "Quiz on history"

**3. Specify difficulty and range**
- ‚úÖ "Include 3 easy recall questions, 4 medium application questions, and 2 challenging synthesis questions"
- ‚ùå "Make it not too hard"

**4. Give context about students**
- ‚úÖ "My 6th graders have been studying this for 2 weeks; they understand the basics but struggle with application"
- ‚ùå No context provided

**5. Request answer keys**
- Add to any assessment prompt: "Provide an answer key with explanations for correct answers"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Assessment Considerations

### Always Verify AI-Generated Assessments

**Check for:**
- ‚úÖ **Factual accuracy** - AI can include incorrect information, especially in STEM
- ‚úÖ **Appropriate difficulty** - AI doesn't know your specific students' levels
- ‚úÖ **Alignment to standards** - Cross-reference with your actual standards
- ‚úÖ **Cultural responsiveness** - Check for bias, ensure examples are inclusive
- ‚úÖ **Clear wording** - Ensure questions aren't ambiguous or confusing
- ‚úÖ **Answer key accuracy** - AI sometimes provides wrong answers or explanations!

### Use AI to Draft, You Approve

- üéØ AI can create assessment structures quickly
- üéØ You bring expertise about your students and curriculum
- üéØ You make final decisions about quality and appropriateness
- üéØ You ensure alignment with what you actually taught
