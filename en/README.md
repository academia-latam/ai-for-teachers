## ‚≠ê Why This Course Matters

> "68% of educators have received NO professional development on AI, yet 60% acknowledge AI can enhance teaching practice. Teachers need practical, ethical guidance - not hype or fear."

AI is already in our classrooms. The question isn't whether teachers will use AI, but whether they'll use it **effectively, ethically, and equitably**.

This course empowers teachers to:
- **Save time** on administrative tasks and lesson planning
- **Enhance learning** through personalized, differentiated instruction
- **Maintain autonomy** as professional decision-makers
- **Teach students** to be critical, informed AI users
- **Lead the transformation** of education in the AI age

**Join us in ensuring that AI serves teachers and students - not the other way around.**
